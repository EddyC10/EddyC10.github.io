        There are many benefits when it comes to working out. Being active is
        essential for not only physical, but mental health as well. Social media
        is a great place to get inspired, information, and even share thoughts
        with like-minded individuals... or is it?

        There are many benefits to the physical aspect of working out. Upon
        beginning, there might be an increase in muscle growth due to your body
        beginning to adjust. This process, is what we call "<b
          ><em>newbie gains</em></b
        >". Although it might benefit males more due to amount of testosterone
        levels that they carry. Women can also benefit from newbie gains as
        well.

      <p class="text">
        "Social media is not reality." "Don't believe everything you see". Are
        just some comments that we have heard over and over again. There are
        many influencers on social media creating inflated expectations for
        users to digest. Although some physiques are achievable natural, they
        may take up years to build up. Watching your favorite youtuber,
        tik-toker, etc grow their body quickly may be tempting. Some may argue
        that the term disease is overexagerating. But is it? Although the
        majority of individuals being impacted by social media are in the
        younger demographics, this concept can apply to anyone.
